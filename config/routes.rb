  # **Top-tip:** There is one important difference between `scope '/admin', module: 'admin'` and
  # `namespace :admin`, and it's in the URL helpers. Remember above that using
  # `scope` gave us a `stats_path` helper. But now that we are using `namespace`,
  # run `rake routes` again. You'll see that the helper is now prefixed with
  # `admin_`, so `stats_path` becomes `admin_stats_path`. If you switch from `scope`
  # to `namespace`, take care to update any URL helpers you have in use!
